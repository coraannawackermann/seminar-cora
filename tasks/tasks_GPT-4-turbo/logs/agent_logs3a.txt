We are working to address the following user request:

Summarize the paper: arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI] 7 Nov 2024, find other papers about this topic and save these the summary and link to other papers in a .txt file on my desktop in a folder the agent should create named seminar.


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.
WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.
Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).

Saleema AmershiModern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at

Saleema AmershiModern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at

---------- MagenticOneOrchestrator ----------

We are working to address the following user request:

Summarize the paper: arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI] 7 Nov 2024, find other papers about this topic and save these the summary and link to other papers in a .txt file on my desktop in a folder the agent should create named seminar.


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.
WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.
Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).


Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and information we have gathered:

1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**
   - The paper's reference number is arXiv:2411.04468v1.
   - The paper was published or submitted on 7 Nov 2024.
   - The subject area of the paper is Computer Science, specifically Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI).
   - The paper is titled "Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks".
   - Authors include Adam Fourney, Gagan Bansal, Hussein Mozannar, Chung Tan, Eduardo Salinas, Erkang (Eric) Zhu, and others.
   - It discusses an open-source agentic system called Magentic-One, which utilizes a multi-agent architecture with a lead agent known as the Orchestrator.

2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**
   - A precise summary of the paper was compiled based on the content viewed on arXiv.
   - Other related papers are being sought on databases such as arXiv, though specific relevant links and summaries still need to be extracted and confirmed.

3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**
   - Identification of significant competitors or technological benchmarks that Magentic-One compares itself against (e.g., GAIA, AssistantBench, WebArena) needs to be explored further for context.
   - Understand the technological implications of the multi-agent architecture and its modularity mentioned in the paper, including how it facilitates adaptability in task management and error recovery.

4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**
   - The paper potentially signifies a significant advancement in agent-based systems for AI due to its architecture allowing for dynamic module integration and real-time problem-solving versatility.
   - Given its discussion on benchmarks and modular design, it's probable that the system is designed to be highly adaptable and efficient in a range of real-world applications, pushing the boundary of current AI systems' interoperability and functionality in dynamic environments.

This revised fact sheet provides a clearer understanding of the known details about the paper and outlines the specific areas where further information is necessary, particularly concerning related research and the technical specifics of the discussed AI system.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

**Root Cause of Failure:**
The main issue in the last run seems to be the failure in successfully retrieving the details of related papers from the 'Related Papers' section on the arXiv page. Repeated attempts to click and access detailed summaries or citations from this section did not yield the required results. Additionally, there was potentially a misunderstanding or technical issue in WebSurfer's capability in accessing the actual content from the section after multiple instructions to do so.

**New Plan:**
- **WebSurfer Task:**
  - Navigating directly to the arXiv page that lists related papers by searching explicitly for "related papers to arXiv:2411.04468v1" if specific browser navigational clicks fail again.
  - Ensuring that once on the correct page, use text extraction to confirm if summaries or titles of papers are present.
  - If details are not retrieved, an alternative approach might be necessary, such as searching through Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar for related works by title.

- **FileSurfer Task:**
  - Confirm the existence of the 'seminar' folder on the desktop; if not present, create it.

- **Coder Task:**
  - Prepare a script that will eventually extract and format the data provided by WebSurfer into a coherent summary and list of links, and then write this script to a .txt file within the 'seminar' folder on the desktop using Python.

- **ComputerTerminal Task:**
  - Once the script is ready, run this Python script to populate the .txt file with the structured information provided by WebSurfer and verified by the orchestrator.

- **Verification and Troubleshooting:**
  - If WebSurfer continues to face issues with accessing exact data from arXiv, shift to using secondary sources like Google Scholar for gathering related paper information.
  - Regularly check the script for errors in fetching or writing data and adjust as necessary.

This plan aims to streamline the process, utilizing specific search queries and ensuring that all agents are clear on tasks and outputs to avoid previous miscommunication or misexecution. It involves a backup approach for gathering information for related papers and ensures all steps are monitored for success.

Saleema AmershiModern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at

Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation.

---------- MagenticOneOrchestrator ----------
Please script a targeted search for academic papers related to the Magentic-One system, focusing on databases like Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar, to find and summarize related papers.
---------- Coder ----------
Here's a Python script using the scholarly library to perform a targeted search on Google Scholar for academic papers related to the Magentic-One system, then to summarize related papers. You need to first install the `scholarly` library if you haven't yet. This can be done using pip.

Script for Installation:
```bash
pip install scholarly
```

Now, here's the Python script for searching and summarizing related papers:

```python
from scholarly import scholarly

def search_related_papers(query):
    search_query = scholarly.search_pubs(query)
    papers = []
    for i, paper in enumerate(search_query):
        if i == 5:  # Limit to top 5 related papers due to large amount of data and time constraints
            break
        result = {'title': paper['bib']['title'],
                  'url': paper['pub_url'],
                  'abstract': paper.get('abstract', 'No abstract available')}
        papers.append(result)
    return papers

def main():
    query = '"Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks"'
    related_papers = search_related_papers(query)
    
    for idx, paper in enumerate(related_papers, start=1):
        print(f"Paper {idx}: {paper['title']}")
        print(f"URL: {paper['url']}")
        print(f"Abstract: {paper['abstract']}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will conduct a search on Google Scholar for papers related to the Magentic-One system. It retrieves and prints the titles, URLs, and abstracts (if available) for the first five related papers found. Keep in mind that this may return the main paper itself if it's highly ranked in related searches; additional filtering can be added if needed.

We are working to address the following user request:

Summarize the paper: arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI] 7 Nov 2024, find other papers about this topic and save these the summary and link to other papers in a .txt file on my desktop in a folder the agent should create named seminar.


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.
WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.
Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).


Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

Here is the revised fact sheet with updated information and adjustments based on our findings and the data we have gathered:

1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**
   - The paper's reference number is arXiv:2411.04468v1.
   - It was published or submitted on 7 Nov 2024.
   - The subject area of the paper is Computer Science, specifically Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI).
   - The title of the paper is "Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks".
   - Authors include Adam Fourney, Gagan Bansal, Hussein Mozannar, Cheng Tan, Eduardo Salinas, Erkang (Eric) Zhu, and others.
   - It discusses Magentic-One, an open-source agentic system utilizing a multi-agent architecture with a lead agent known as the Orchestrator.
   - The paper details benchmarks against systems like GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena.

2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**
   - We need to extract and compile summaries and citations of related papers. This task has proven challenging due to difficulties in navigating and extracting specific data from academic websites. Future attempts should consider different databases or methods.

3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**
   - Further exploration into the modular design mentioned in the paper, specifically how this modularity enhances system flexibility and adaptability in various environments.
   - Exploration of the Orchestrator's role in error management and system efficiency, which is central to understanding the operational advantages of Magentic-One.

4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**
   - The paper likely discusses significant advancements in the field of AI through the introduction of a robust and adaptable multi-agent system. The implementation allows for problem-solving versatility without the need for reprogramming or excessive development adjustments.
   - It is probable that Magentic-One's ability to operate without modifying core agent capabilities or collaboration methods indicates a move towards more autonomous and self-regulating AI systems. This could lead to broader application in areas requiring adaptive response without human intervention.
   - Given the focus on benchmarks mentioned in the paper, Magentic-One could be seen as setting a new standard or at least a competitive option in agentic systems for complex task environments.

These revisions and updates to the fact sheet reflect our better understanding of the paper's content and context, as well as highlighting areas that require more detailed investigation or successful access to data.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

**Root Cause of Failure:**
The main difficulty in the last run was related to efficiently identifying and extracting data on related academic papers:

1. Ineffective navigation and use of academic databases (like arXiv and Google Scholar) led to difficulty in accessing detailed summaries or citations of related papers.
2. Failure to transition smoothly to alternative search strategies when initial efforts (like direct navigational clicks on arXiv's related papers) did not deliver the expected results.
3. The lack of direct extraction of related papers' summaries and metadata from databases hampered progress.

**New Plan:**
To better tackle the task, here’s a revised approach utilizing the capabilities of the team agents:

- **WebSurfer Task:**
  - Use direct searches on Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar via browsing to find related papers to "Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks".
  - Extract titles, abstracts, and publication links for the top relevant papers.
  - If information extraction proves difficult, consider using direct linking or PDF downloading for detail retrieval.

- **Coder Task:**
  - Develop a Python script to interface with scholarly databases (if direct extraction by WebSurfer is inefficient). Use the `scholarly` library to perform targeted searches.
  - Prepare to parse any PDFs or HTML pages downloaded or accessed by WebSurfer, extracting necessary data for the summary.

- **FileSurfer Task:**
  - Verify the presence or create a folder named 'seminar' on the desktop if missing.
  - Prepare to manage file systems for any downloads or file creations needed for saving summaries and related information.

- **ComputerTerminal Task:**
  - Execute Python scripts provided by Coder to aggregate and format the research data.
  - Manage any shell commands needed for file handling or environment setup for script execution.

- **Overall Coordination:**
  - Ensure all parts of the task (search, extraction, file management) are clearly defined and that inter-agent tasks are well-coordinated.
  - Monitor each stage for completion and accuracy, adjusting the workflow as needed based on the results and efficiency of the strategy.

This new plan aims to refine the search and extraction processes, utilize the strengths of each agent effectively, and ensure that a comprehensive set of related papers is curated and documented properly. By adjusting strategies based on observed pitfalls and maintaining agility in methods, the likelihood of success in compiling a detailed report increases.

Abstract
Modern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce 
Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the 
Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator also directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. Our experiments show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Notably, Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards the vision of 
generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One’s modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner – which is important when agents’ actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at

**Main Paper:**

**Title:** Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks  
**Authors:** Adam Fourney, Gagan Bansal, Hussein Mozannar, Cheng Tan, Eduardo Salinas, Erkang (Eric) Zhu, and others  
**Link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04468v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04468v1)  
**Summary:**  
Magentic-One, developed by researchers at Microsoft Research AI Frontiers, is a high-performing, open-source multi-agent system designed to handle complex tasks. The system features an Orchestrator, a lead agent responsible for planning, tracking progress, and replanning to manage errors. Specialized agents within the system can perform a variety of tasks, such as web browsing, file navigation, and executing Python scripts. Magentic-One has been tested against GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena benchmarks, showing competitive performance without needing modifications to the core capabilities or collaborative methods of its agents. The system's modular design facilitates easy adaptations, including the addition or removal of agents without retraining or prompt tuning. The paper also introduces AutoGenBench, a tool for agentic evaluation, which ensures rigorous testing environments.
