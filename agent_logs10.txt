ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch

---------- MagenticOneOrchestrator ----------
Please provide an alternative method to install PyTorch, or suggest checking the Python environment and PyPI index URL to ensure they're correctly configured.
---------- Coder ----------
To resolve the installation issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check Python and pip Versions:**
   Ensure that your Python and pip versions are up-to-date. Run:

   ```sh
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

2. **Upgrade pip:**
   Upgrade pip to the latest version:

   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

3. **Check PyPI Index URL:**
   Ensure your pip configuration isn't restricting the PyPI index URL. You can reset any custom index URL:

   ```sh
   pip config unset global.index-url
   ```

4. **Use Conda (if applicable):**
   If you're using Anaconda, try installing PyTorch via conda:

   ```sh
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```

5. **Visit PyTorch Installation Page:**
   Access [PyTorch's official installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for a custom installation command based on your system (OS, CUDA version).

Try these steps and see if you can successfully install PyTorch. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

We are working to address the following user request:

Find a GitHub project that demonstrates a cool AI demo using PyTorch. Download the repository, summarize its purpose and main functionality, and run a working demo if available.


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.
WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.
Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).


Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

Here's an updated fact sheet:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - The request involves finding a GitHub project.
   - The project should demonstrate a cool AI demo.
   - The project should use PyTorch.
   - We attempted to download and summarize the PyTorch examples repository.
   - Issues arose while attempting to install PyTorch using pip due to Python version compatibility.

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - Specific GitHub projects that use PyTorch for AI demos.
   - The functionality and purpose of the identified GitHub project.
   - Instructions or documentation for running the demo provided in the GitHub repository.
   - Confirm the appropriate Python version and installation requirements for PyTorch.

3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - Criteria for what might be considered a "cool" AI demo, based on current trends and interests in AI technology.
   - Steps involved in downloading and running a GitHub project, if not explicitly provided in the repository documentation.

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework, often used in applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, or generative models.
   - A "cool" AI demo might involve interactive elements, visual outputs, or innovative applications of deep learning techniques.
   - Python 3.13 may not yet be universally supported, suggesting a need to try an earlier version like Python 3.8 or 3.9 for compatibility.
  
The Python version 3.13 seems to be too new, possibly causing compatibility issues with PyTorch. Trying an earlier Python version may resolve this.


Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

### Root Cause of Failure

The primary issue was attempting to install PyTorch on a Python 3.13 environment, which is not yet supported by PyTorch. This led to installation failures as there are no available compatible builds of PyTorch for Python 3.13.

### New Plan

- **WebSurfer:** 
  - Verify the Python versions supported by PyTorch on its official website to ensure we're using a compatible version.
  - Search for alternative PyTorch examples that might offer easier demos with minimal dependencies.

- **FileSurfer:** 
  - Prepare to download any newly identified repositories for PyTorch demos.

- **Coder:** 
  - Recommend downgrading Python to a supported version (e.g., Python 3.8 or 3.9).
  - Provide instructions for setting up a new virtual environment with a compatible Python version.
  - Ensure that the PyTorch installation command aligns with the Python version and system specs.

- **ComputerTerminal:**
  - Set up a new virtual environment with the recommended Python version.
  - Install PyTorch and other dependencies within this environment.
  - Attempt to run a demo from the repository to ensure the setup is working and the demo functions as expected.

By addressing the Python compatibility issue, this plan focuses on setting the correct environment prerequisites, ensuring a successful execution of the PyTorch demo.

---------- MagenticOneOrchestrator ----------
