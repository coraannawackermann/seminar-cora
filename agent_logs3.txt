We are working to address the following user request:

Summarize the paper: arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI] 7 Nov 2024, find other Papers about this topic and save these the summary and link to other papers in a .txt file on my desktop in a folder called seminar.


To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.
WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.
Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.
ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).


Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
   - The request involves summarizing a paper identified by its arXiv identifier: arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI].
   - The paper's submission date is 7 Nov 2024.
   - The topic is likely related to computer science and artificial intelligence (as suggested by the classification [cs.AI]).

2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
   - The content and abstract of the paper with the identifier arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI]. This can be found on the arXiv website or repository.
   - Other papers about the same topic, which might require looking up via academic databases, research paper repositories, or citation networks like Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, or the arXiv database itself.

3. FACTS TO DERIVE
   - Based on the summary of the paper, determining the core topic or field of study to find relevant other literature.

4. EDUCATED GUESSES
   - The paper pertains to recent developments or research trends in artificial intelligence, given its submission under that category.
   - Other related papers could be found using keywords from the paper’s title and abstract, which would typically highlight the specific niche or subtopic within AI.




Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

- **WebSurfer**: 
  - Look up the paper using the arXiv identifier arXiv:2411.04468v1 [cs.AI] on the arXiv website.
  - Summarize the contents of the paper.
  - Search for other papers that are related to the topic of this paper using the arXiv database or other academic resources like Google Scholar.
  - Gather the summaries and links to these papers.
  
- **Coder**:
  - Prepare the text data of summaries and links formatted for saving.
  
- **FileSurfer**:
  - Create a folder named "seminar" on the desktop.
  - Save the summarized text and links into a .txt file within the "seminar" folder. 

This plan efficiently utilizes the strengths of each team member to fulfill the request completely.

Saleema AmershiModern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at
