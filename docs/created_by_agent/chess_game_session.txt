Feedback:
- The opening e4 was a strong central opening, but more control of the center was needed.
- Knights were developed well but over-exchanged. Improve bishop positioning.
- Avoid losing valuable pieces. Tactical oversight needs correction.
- Continuous improvement can be seen by focusing on positional coordinates.
